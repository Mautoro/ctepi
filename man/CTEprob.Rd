\description{
This function calculates the CTE(0) distribution for a dichotomous outcome over all possible worlds
that are consistent with the observed data.
}
\details{
The variable \eqn{\mathcal{M}} represents the set of labels for the individuals in the population of interest.
Observed causal inference data are typically presented as variables defined for each individual \eqn{m \in M}.
The outcome \eqn{Y} is defined over the space \eqn{\mathcal{M} \times \{0, 1\}}, where \eqn{K(m, z) = 1} if \eqn{Y(m, z)} is observed,
and 0 otherwise. \eqn{Z} is the projection of \eqn{(m, z)} in \eqn{Z}, meaning \eqn{Z(m, z) = z}.

The outcome \eqn{Y} is dichotomous, and each missing outcome value can take either 0 or 1.
Consider the space of all possible worlds where for each world, there exists an outcome \eqn{Y^*},
where \eqn{Y^*} coincides with the observed outcome \eqn{Y_{\text{obs}}} for the observed statistical units.
For each \eqn{Y^*}, the CTE(0) is computed. The CTE(0) is a random variable over all possible worlds.

The value \eqn{p} represents the prior probability that each unobserved outcome is 1. This prior probability is denoted as
the propensity for success. Assuming a common \eqn{p} for all unobserved outcomes implies the absence of a causal effect.
Based on \eqn{p}, the probability of each possible world is determined. If all possible worlds are equally likely, \eqn{p = 0.5},
which assumes no causal effect. This assumption becomes unrealistic when the outcome's success probability is significantly
different from 0.5.
